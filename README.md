## 👋 About

This repository hosts my personal portfolio built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

I work across three focused verticals:

* **MindTinkers** — STEM education for schools
* **ArtTechies** — Technical partnerships for artists & installations
* **WowPlay** — Thoughtfully designed toys for toddlers

The site is intentionally simple, fast, and framework-free.
